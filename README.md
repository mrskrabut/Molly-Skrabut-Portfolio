### Projects

#### Grade calculator

 - I came up with this project by accumulating previous grades from my courses to have a glance at my future overall grade in the class. This grade calculator gave me the ability to enter grades that I did not yet have to see what I would need to reach my goal grade. I could enter different grades for remaining tests and final exams in order to have a better grasp on what is needed from me to finish up the course. I used excel and different mathematical functions within it to complete this project. A challenge that I faced was adjusting different fields for what I was entering. I had to remember to change it to a percentage if that was necessary or else the functions would not work the same. I collaborated with other classmates to help troubleshoot any issues we encountered throughout the way. I set out to achieve a way to see how my future grades would add up for certain classes. I did achieve it by having the ability to enter different grades and calculating what my final grade would be. If I had a chance to take this further I would maybe add more columns for things like attendance and participation. Making a grade calculator allowed me to visualize how my current grades and predicted grades would add up in the end to give me a final grade for a certain course.

#### Side business

 - I came up with the idea for my shoe side business by the interest of how prices varied for just a different brand of sneakers. I set out to see how much I would need to sell certain shoes to make a profit if I were to start a business of buying and selling shoes. I used excel and tools like sum and addition to complete this project. A challenge I faced was trying to figure out how much I should sell the shoes for to make sure that I would make a profit off my business. I collaborated with other classmates to help troubleshoot any issues we encountered throughout the way. I also used online sources to help find what these certain shoes would usually sell for. I set out to achieve a business that would allow me to make a profit. I think I achieved this for the most part. If I had a chance to take this further I would include things like tax. The side business project allowed me to pick something that interested me and have the ability to navigate having a business in it and making a profit out of it.
