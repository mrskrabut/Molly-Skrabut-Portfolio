### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced BioHealth major and aspiring Physical Therapist professional with over 2 years of proven expertise in physical therapy and scoliosis therapy. 


With skills in pediatrics, sports medicine, rehabilitation, and analysis, I am able to devise exercise programs, and achieve improvement in strength and stamina. I am adept at using Excel, Python 3, and Access. 


My assorted skill set, commitment to detail, and passion for helping others qualify me as a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to paint and hike.
